# SQL-project
I have done this project for my educational purpose.
This project is a SQL-based analysis of Fassos' sales data, and zomato which I worked on, The goal was to explore and analyze sales trends using SQL queries to extract key business insights.

 What I Did:-
 Data Cleaning & Transformation – Organized raw sales data for better analysis  Sales Performance Analysis – Identified top-selling items and revenue trends
 Customer Insights – Analyzed buying patterns and order frequency

 SQL Functions & Concepts Used:-
 
-Aggregation Functions – SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() for revenue and order analysis

-Window Functions – RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() for ranking top-selling items
 
-String Functions – UPPER(), LOWER(), CONCAT() for formatting and cleaning data

-Date Functions – YEAR(), MONTH(), DATEDIFF() to analyze sales over time

-Joins & CTEs – Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and WITH CTE to combine multiple tables
